# HighDigitSAMs
A simple, IC-compliant mod for DCS to add more SAM systems to the game, both modern and historical.  

## How to Install
Simply copy the Mods folder into your C:\Username\Saved Games\DCS folder, or use OVGME to install the files there.  

## Current features  

### S-300PMU-1 (SA-20A Gargoyle) Complex  
This upgraded version of the S-300 added ABM capability and the long range 48N6 missile to the advanced S-300 complex.  
All components labelled as SA-20 in the mission editor. ABM-optimized missiles coming soon!  
The complex can also accommodate launchers for the 5V55RUD missiles.  
Now includes a truck-mounted 30N6 radar, 3D model by EKO.

### S-300VM (SA-23 Gladiator/Giant) Complex (contributed by LetMePickThat)
This upgraded variant of the S-300V features Track-Via-Missile guidance and the extremely capable 9M82M anti-ballstic missile, in addition to the 9M83M missile, all on a tracked chassis.    
All components labelled as SA-23 in the mission editor, complete with custom 3D models created by EKO.  

### 5V55RUD Missile for the S-300PS (SA-10c) complex  
This upgraded missile has improved guidance from the original 5V55R, increasing its effective range vs. aircraft significantly.  
Maximum range increased to 90km.  
Available in the mission editor via the dedicated SA-10 (5V55RUD) launchers.  

### 9K317 Buk-M1-2 (SA-17 Grizzly) Transporter/Erector/Launcher and Radar, 9A310M1-2  
This upgraded Buk TELAR carries a more capable radar, and fires the 9M317 missiles, which is longer-ranged and more agile than the original 9M38 Buk missile.  
This variant has an improved ability to defend itself from anti-radiation missiles. ABM capability and support units coming to the complex soon!  

### V-759/5V23 Missile for S-75 (SA-2) Complex  
This late-production missile for the SA-2 has an improved warhead, maneuverability and G-tolerance compared to previous versions, and was widely exported in the 1970s.  
Note: This missile is modeled very differently from the default DCS version of the SA-2. Its guidance and maneuverability have been tuned based on documentation to hopefully much better reflect the actual capabilities of this system. Do not expect this missile to miss you if you do not defend properly!  
Add to your SA-2 complex by selecting the launcher for the V-759 in the mission editor.  

### V-601P/5V27 Missile for S-125 (SA-3) Complex  
This upgraded missile for the SA-3 features a number of improvements to the guidance and rocket motor.  
Note: this version performs much more closely to the historical SA-3 than the DCS version, and as such it is generally much less dangerous to face.  
Add to your SA-3 complex by selecting the launcher for the V-601P in the mission editor.  

### HQ-2 Missile  
This Chinese-developed copy of the S-75 makes a number of upgrades to its performance, particularly guidance, overload capability and kinematic performance.  
Note: Associated radar systems not included until I can figure out a way to add RWR symbology without breaking IC.  
Add to your SA-2 complex by selecting the HQ-2 launcher in the mission editor, available to China, Iran, and CJTF Red.  

### 9K338 Igla-S (SA-24) MANPADS
The 9K338 system features significant kinematic and countermeasure resistance improvements from the previous 9K38 Igla. It fires the 9M342 missile which has an average speed of 650 meters per second.  
Selectable in the mission editor as the SAM SA-24 Igla-S.  

### 9K34 Strela-3 (SA-14) MANPADS
The 9K34 system was a major improvement over the previous 9K32 Strela-2, featuring a limited all-aspect engagement capability and improved fusing.  
It saw service around the world from the late 1970s onward.  
Selectable in the mission editor as the SAM SA-14 Strela-3.
